# FastAPI + Machine Learning Model

This template provides a simple setup to deploy machine learning models using FastAPI, with support for various models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Currently, the API supports the following models:

- **Linear Regression** for predicting scores based on features
- **Random Forest** for more complex predictions with multiple features
- **XGBoost** for optimized, high-performance prediction tasks

## Expanding the Project

If you're looking to expand this project, you can integrate more machine learning models or connect it to a front-end framework like React to visualize predictions in real time. You can also scale the system by adding more features or deploying it to cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.

For integrating more models, check out the [ML models documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/) for new techniques and algorithms to experiment with.
